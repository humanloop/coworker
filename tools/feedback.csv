Duolingo,Stephen, an AI engineer at Duolingo, is attempting to create an evaluator LLM that other team members can turn on. He encountered several difficulties and made suggestions for improvements, including: 1. Confusion about evaluators being shared across the whole orgs projects. 2. Difficulty in using the Editor to iterate on his evaluator due to UX issues. 3. Desire to upload test cases via .csv. 4. Confusion about the pending state and the need to refresh to see an update. 5. Desire for an easier way to get to an f1 score. 6. Confusion about a test case not just being a datapoint. 7. Desire for better version control for prompts, similar to what github offers. 8. Issues with project management, including different naming conventions and the need for folders. 9. Concerns about bothering everyone with draft work, suggesting a need for private/public workspace.,Medium,User Experience,2023-09-05
